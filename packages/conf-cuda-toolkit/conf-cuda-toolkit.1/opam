  # See: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#meta-packages
  # The meta-package cuda-toolkit should not include drivers,
  # therefore it is typically safe to install both on regular distributions and on WSL.
  # Sometimes (e.g. Arch Linux) cuda-toolkit is provided by a cuda package that does include drivers.
